# ProjectPlanners_Prediction_System_for_Medicine
This is a Prediction System of Medicine for Various Health Issues. I have used multiple Data Preprocessing and Data Handling techniques.
After that, general Data Analysis has been performed on the datasets.
In the last and most important part, I have trained a Multinomial Naive-Bayes Classifier to predict the correct medicine for a particular health issue.
At the very end, there are some predictions that can be verified from the data as well that these are correct predictions.
Thanks for reading my post.
